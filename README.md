## How To Play
It's easy to play. First, you have a player you can move the arrow keys to the right, left, up and down. You should reach the blue area by going up and runaway from bugs. Once you are in green area you are safe. If any of those bugs hit you, you will start from the first position. You can be a winner if you get to the blue area, then it will show you the alert. You can press OK to restart the game.
